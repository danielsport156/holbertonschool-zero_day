# project 1

In this project we had to create a new repository on "Github" with the description given in the project. Then we had to enter our "terminal" or "command prompt" and through our virtual machine create two directories with one file each. Make sure you create the directory individually and use "git init" command ONLY ONCE under the first directory. once we do "git init", then we add the origin on which the specific command can be looked up on "Github" in your account on the repository code which you created. When done, create the file "REDME.md" with emacs and write the info needed/provided for each file on the project description. After each file is created use the code provided in the repository you created on the second section to "push" file so that it can be uploaded on the "Github" repository file.
