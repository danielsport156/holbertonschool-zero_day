# project 3

In this project I had to create  a new directories, using my "VM" through the directory called
"0x03-git". After the new directories(aka:bash, c, js) were made, I created files with emacs(
aka:bash/holberton, bash/school) and inside I had to type in the information given in the proj
ect instructions. When finished, I added the files to my "Github repository".

In the second part I had to create a new "git branch" named "update_script". Then switch to 
the new branch to create an empty folder named "bash/98" and update both files(aka:bah/holber-
ton, bash/school) with the text provided in the projects instructions. Once I added them to my 
"Github repository" I switched back to the "master" branch to update the file "bash/holberton" 
by editing the text given in the projects instructions. After that I just deleted the directory
called "js" and finally added all the files again to my "Github repository".

For this final part from the project, I had to go to my "Github.com" account online and edit
the file called "README.md" manually. Once the file was edited I had to update locally my file 
inside the "terminal command line" using the command "git pull". Then I created a new empty 
file called "up_to_date" so that I can "git add" the file then "git commit" with the text prov-
ided in the project instructions to then "git push" to my "Github repository".
